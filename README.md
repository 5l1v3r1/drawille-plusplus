drawille-plusplus
=================

An implementation of [drawille](https://github.com/asciimoo/drawille) in C++.

Do not forget to set your locale with `std::locale::global(std::locale(""));` at the beginning of your program to enable wide-character support.

Header-only, to use in your project simply include `drawille.hpp` and compile with C++11 support or later.

I may write more examples at a later date, or you are free to contribute some via pull request.

Please raise any bugs in the issues section of this repository.

Special thanks go to [Rei](https://github.com/sovietspaceship) for testing and suggestions.
