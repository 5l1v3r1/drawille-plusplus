drawille-plusplus
=================

An implementation of [drawille](https://github.com/asciimoo/drawille) in C++.

Currently depends on the ICU library for unicode support.

Header-only, to use in your project simply include `drawille.hpp` and compile with `-licuuc -licuio`.

I may write more examples at a later date, or you are free to contribute some via pull request.

Please raise any bugs in the issues section of this repository.

Special thanks go to [Rei](https://github.com/sovietspaceship) for testing and suggestions.
